        <h3>Reviews and Book Summary</h3>
        <ol type="a">
            <li><b>The theory of Everything:</b> <br>“The Theory of Everything” is a story of faith, belief, and love. It is a story about defying impossible odds, made even more inspirational in that it actually happened.</li>
            <li><b>The Silent Patient:</b> <br>The novel suggests that individuals carry their trauma with them through life, holding onto it long after the traumatic incident itself has passed. Likewise, Alicia's childhood is marred by her mother's suicide and her subsequent upbringing by an unkind aunt and emotionally abusive father.</li>
            <li><b>It Ends with Us:</b> <br>It sheds light on the complexities of abusive relationships and the courage it takes to break free from them. Through Lily's journey, we are reminded of the importance of self-love, forgiveness, and the ability to create our own happy endings, even in the face of adversity.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Reviews on Movies</h3>
        <ul type="square">
            <li><em>Titanic (8.5 out of 10):</em> <br> The main themes of the film include love, class conflict, and tragedy. The film explores the relationship between Jack and Rose, how they come from different social classes and how this affects their relationship.</li>
            <li><em>Fast And Furious (9.5 out of 10):</em><br>We learn not to be afraid of disseminating love to our families and its this bond that keeps everyone together. We also see from the beginning when Brian-undercover cop (Paul Walker) chose to let Dom (Vin Diesel) 'disappear' after committing alleged crimes because he got to see the real side to the story.</li>
            <li><em>Avatar (9 out of 10):</em> <br>Change and transformation are central themes in "Avatar." The film emphasizes the need for personal growth and the willingness to adapt to new circumstances. Through the character arc of Jake Sully, we witness the transformative power of empathy, understanding, and embracing a new way of life.</li>
